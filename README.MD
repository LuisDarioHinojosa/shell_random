# MISC SCRIPTS
Some miscellaneus scripts written by myself mostly in python, batch, or bash. Some of them are for automating tasks, for automating pentesting and networking tasks, or to please my whimsies and dispatch them via config files. If you find something useful, feel free to use it as you please.

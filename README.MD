# MISC SCRIPTS
Some miscellaneus scripts written by myself mostly in python, batch, or bash. Some of them are for automating managment, pentesting, and networking tasks. Some are simply to please my whimsies and dispatch them via config files. If you find something useful, feel free to use it as you please.

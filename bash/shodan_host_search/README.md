# Shodan Host Search
This script uses the Shodan CLI to search for information available on a list of hosts. The output will be writen to a directory called ```shodan_search_output``` in a text file whose name matches the host. 
## Usage:
```
./shodan_host_search.sh host.txt
```
**It is important for the host file to be called ```host.txt```.**
